### JavaScript Tutorial in Urdu

## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that is essential for web development. It enables developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages, making it one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamental concepts of JavaScript in Urdu, making it accessible for Urdu-speaking learners.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that allows developers to implement complex features on web pages. It is primarily used for client-side development, but with the advent of Node.js, it can also be used for server-side programming. JavaScript brings websites to life by enabling interactive elements, animations, and much more.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

1. **High Demand**: JavaScript is one of the most in-demand programming languages in the tech industry. Learning it can open up numerous job opportunities.
2. **Versatile**: With JavaScript, you can work on both front-end and back-end development, mobile applications, and even game development.
3. **Rich Ecosystem**: The JavaScript ecosystem is vast, with numerous libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js that help streamline the development process.
4. **Easy to Learn**: For beginners, JavaScript has a relatively low barrier to entry, making it an excellent starting point for learning programming.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with JavaScript, you need a few essential tools:

- **Text Editor**: Choose a text editor where you will write your code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.
- **Web Browser**: Youâ€™ll need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to run and test your JavaScript code.

### Writing Your First JavaScript Program

Let's start with a simple example. Open your text editor and create a new file named `index.html`. Add the following code:

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First JavaScript Program</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <script>
      console.log("Welcome to JavaScript!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## JavaScript Basics

### Variables

Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

```javascript
// Using var
var name = "Ali";
console.log(name);

// Using let
let age = 25;
console.log(age);

// Using const
const country = "Pakistan";
console.log(country);
```

### Data Types

JavaScript has several data types, including:

1. **Primitive Types**: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol.
2. **Non-Primitive Types**: Object, Array, Function.

```javascript
// Primitive types
let text = "Hello"; // String
let number = 42; // Number
let isTrue = true; // Boolean
let empty = null; // Null
let notDefined; // Undefined

// Non-Primitive types
let arr = [1, 2, 3]; // Array
let obj = { key: "value" }; // Object
```

### Operators

JavaScript supports various operators:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 20;

console.log(a + b); // Addition
console.log(a === b); // Strict equality
console.log(a < b && b > 15); // Logical AND
```

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. You can define functions using `function` keyword or arrow syntax.

```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("Ali"));

// Arrow function
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
console.log(add(5, 10));
```

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Classes and Objects

JavaScript uses prototypes but supports class-based syntax for OOP.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Ali", 30);
person1.greet();
```

## Advanced Topics

### Asynchronous Programming

JavaScript handles asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

#### Promises Example

```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched"), 2000);
  });
};

fetchData().then((data) => console.log(data));
```

#### Async/Await Example

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  const data = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched"), 2000);
  });
  console.log(data);
};

fetchData();
```

### DOM Manipulation

You can use JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model).

```javascript
// Changing the content of an HTML element
const heading = document.querySelector("h1");
heading.textContent = "Hello, JavaScript!";

// Adding an event listener
heading.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Heading clicked!");
});
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial provides an overview of JavaScript basics, advanced concepts, and practical examples. With consistent practice, you can master JavaScript and create dynamic, interactive web applications.
